Hi there! What are your favorite questions about teaching, learning, creativity, and design?

Here's a collection of quotes gathered by the WI+RE team:

> When everyone in the classroom, teacher and students recognizes that they are responsible for creating a learning community together, learning is at its most meaningful and useful.
> - <cite>bell hooks, Teaching Critical Thinking: Practical Wisdom</cite>


> Dream a little before you think. 
>
> _Toni Morrison_

> Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up.
>
> _Pablo Picasso_

> Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,  
the world offers itself to your imagination,  
calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting â€“  
over and over announcing your place  
in the family of things.
>
>_Mary Oliver_, "Wild Geese"

> Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things. And the reason they were able to do that was that they've had more experiences or they have thought more about their experiences than other people.

>_Steve Jobs_

>The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.
>
>_Sylvia Plath_

>You've got to jump off cliffs all the time and build your wings on the way down.
>
>_Annie Dillard_

>We live in a bewildering world.
>
>_Stephen Hawking_

>Too busy watering my own grass to notice if yours is greener.
>
>_Russ_

>Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing about.
>
>_Benjamin Franklin_

>Today is the first day of the rest of your life.
>
>_John Denvor_
